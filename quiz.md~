## Quiz Questions

1. The "API First" approach to designing APIs means :
   - [x] Your API is a first-class citizen of your design
   - [ ] You tell your developers to work on _your_ API before any other project
   - [ ] You write the code for the API before you have any meetings to talk about why you need the API
1. The "Three Pillars of API Design" are:
   - [ ] source code, testing, and security
   - [ ] documentation, diagrams, and definitions
   - [ ] providers, consumers, and designers
   - [x] business problem, target audience, and design features
1. An API Design Assets are:
   - [ ] A list of all the APIs in the design.
   - [x] Any digital resources created or used in the design process.
   - [ ] A list of reasons for creating the API.
   - [ ] A cost-benefit review of the proposed API.
1. The three key elements of API Design Assets are:
   - [ ] API Documentation, API Source Code, and API Deployment script
   - [ ] API Definition, API Glossary, and API Security Review
   - [x] API Story, API Vocabulary, and API Diagram
   - [ ] API's OKR document, API's LPI List, and API Monitoring Variables 
1. An API prototype is:
   - [ ] The final production version of your API
   - [x] The preliminary model of your API
   - [ ] A waste of time and money
   - [ ] The complete detailed documentation for your API   
1. API prototypes are:
   - [ ] Best left alone
   - [ ] Not useful when designing APIs
   - [x] Made to be tested
1. The OpenAPI Components section helps you to:
   - [ ] Skip annoying OpenAPI requirements
   - [ ] Use genAI to complete your OpenAPI document
   - [x] Organize your OpenAPI Definition
1. The four key elements of the OpenAPI components section are:
   - [ ] headers, footers, bodies, and arguments
   - [ ] security, transparency, reusability, and stability
   - [x] parameters, schema, responses, and requestBodies
   - [ ] north, south, east, and west
1. In OpenAPI, the *path* section is:
   - [ ] An optional section
   - [x] The 'heart' of the OpenAPI document
   - [ ] Only required if your API supports HTTP DELETE
1. The top-level element in each path entry is:
   - [x] The resource URL
   - [ ] The HTTP method
   - [ ] The *requestBody* element
   - [ ] The *parameters* element   
1. Mock objects are:
   - [x] Similated objects you can use to test your API
   - [ ] A kind of turtle soup
   - [ ] Fake objects you can use to overwrite your production API
   - [ ] A special administrative gateway for injecting tests at runtime.
1. SRT is an acronym that stands for:
   - [ ] Special Response Terminal
   - [x] Simple Request Tests
   - [ ] Semantic Representation Type
   - [ ] Searchable Response Text
1. The "Hippocratic Oath of APIs" is:
   - [x] First, do no harm
   - [ ] Never ride on a hippopotamus
   - [ ] Always monitor the health of your APIs
1. When testing your API modifications :
   - [ ] Always rewrite the existing tests
   - [ ] Ignore any errors you see from exsiting operations
   - [x] Always run the existing tests along with the new functionality tests
