# Designing APIs with OpenAPI
_**Build the Right APIs the Right Way**_

## Mike Amundsen, *Author*

### Teaser

In this workshop, join industry expert Mike Amundsen for an in-depth, hands-on exploration of API design using the OpenAPI Specification. This workshop will cover core principles and modern techniques for designing effective, scalable APIs that meet real-world needs. Participants will learn how to leverage the OpenAPI Specification to create clear, reusable, and maintainable API contracts that drive efficient development and robust client-server interactions.

### Who's it for?

This workshop is ideal for software engineers, API designers, architects, product managers, and technical decision-makers who are interested in enhancing their API design skills with OpenAPI standards. It is suited for those with basic API knowledge looking to gain advanced insights and practical skills in API design and implementation.

### What you will learn

 * Core principles of effective API design
 * How to create and document APIs using the OpenAPI Specification
 * Strategies for making APIs reusable, scalable, and secure
 * Practical approaches to API versioning, error handling, and testing
 * How to collaborate efficiently across teams using OpenAPI contracts

### Contents

In this workshop, you'll learn the importance of the three pillars of API Design and how to apply those pillars to the creation of API design assets (story, diagram, and vocabulary). 

You'll understand the value of prototyping your API and how to use prototyping to document and explore your API design using OpenAPI.  You'll master the ability to use OpenAPI to document your design schemas, responses, requests, and parameter details. You'll also learn to construct API Paths including URLs, HTTP methods, requests and responses. 

Once you build your OpenAPI document, you'll be able to generate an API Mock and develop simple API request tests in order to validate your API design. 

Finally, you'll learn see how you can model changes to your completed APIs by applying versioning and other change management strategies in order to safely and consistently modify your API while it is in production.
