_No more than ~150 words_

## Examples
Here are some example "Three Pillars" documents:

### Assigning Sales Reps to New Clients
 1. We need a better solution for our assigning sales representatives to new clients.
 2. we have lots of JavaScript developers who know NodeJS and HTTP so let's create a RESTful API to make it easy to assign sales reps to clients.
 3. We'll need a way to see a list of available sales reps, a list of clients with no assigned rep, and actions to add or remove a sales rep to a client.

### Checking the Status of Waiting Projects
 1. It's too involved to check the status of an order for a customer.
 2. Most of our developers know C# and most of our end-users are used to Linux command-line apps so we'll create a small CLI app in C# that can run in the Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL).
 3. We'll need to be able to enter an order number and get back a status message (work history, assigned craftsman, estimated completion date)
 
### Postal Code Validation for Online Orders
 1. Too many customer provide improper postal code data for their orders and we have to do extra work to check each order.
 2. This needs to work on a web page and fit into the company UI style guide (react-like instant feedback, etc.) 
 3. We need a single action (triggered by a keystroke or [enter-key] that looks up the postal code and returns "true" if valida or "false" if not.
